    "Write a program that has a user play a memory game using lists. \n",
    "This Python programming assignment will guide you through the exciting process of creating your own memory game, a classic and engaging exercise that tests your ability to remember and match pairs of items. In this game the cards will be represented as numbers in a list and their location will be indices of the list. By completing this project, you will practice critical list concepts. Not only will this enhance your problem-solving skills, but you will also have a lot of fun as you watch the game come to life and challenge yourself or your friends to find all the pairs.\n",

It also must be one where the value of the displayed list at that index must be '*' (otherwise it is an index which has already been guessed). If the user does not enter a valid index, ask them to give you a new index. We recommend that you define a new function get_valid_index which takes in the displayed list and returns the valid index the user entered.\n",

Otherwise, if the values don't match, you should tell the user the values, but do not update the displayed list. Of course, you should first make sure the user didn't enter the same index twice. Here are a few examples. Imagine the current value of displayed and truth lists are as follows:\n",
