    "To explore our interest in a baby's vocabulary, write a program that loops over a list of words made by a baby, counts the appearance of each word, and then makes a histogram from counts. For the histogram formatting, have the words appear vertically and the bars appear horizontally. For the bars, represent each appearance of a word with a singular 'x'. See below for an example. We've already loaded the list of words from a file for you in the starter code. Check it out if you'd like. :)\n",

    "Histograms can be thought of as a chart that looks like a bunch of connected bars. Each bar represents different groups or ranges of numbers. The height of each bar shows how many things (like data points or occurrences) fall into that group. In this case, each bar will belong to a word the baby said and how tall the bar is depends on how many times the baby said that specific word.\n",
